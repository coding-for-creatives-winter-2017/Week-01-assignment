				<li><i>They're escape artists</i></li>
					<p>Red pandas have also escaped from zoos in London, Birmingham, and Rotterdam. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums even warn in their official care manual “beware: red pandas are escape artists” </p>
				<li><i>They have a false thumb.</i></li>
					<p> This is another feature (along with diet) that red pandas and giant pandas share. Because both pandas have false thumbs—which is actually an extended wrist bone—it was thought that it must be an adaption to eating bamboo. But the red panda’s more carnivorous ancestors had this feature as well. </p>
				<li><i>They have a internet browser named after them.</i></li>
					<p> Mozilla’s flagship browser, Firefox, means red panda. Originally, Mozilla wanted to name the browser Firebird, but found that another open source project was using that name. Not wanting to upset anyone, they decided to go with Firefox, another name for the red panda. And in a true example of adorableness, in 2010 Mozilla adopted two baby red pandas that had been born at Tennessee's Knoxville Zoo. </p>
				<li><i>They're vegetarian carnivores.</i></li>
					<p> It might seem like an oxymoron, but carnivore in this case doesn’t mean meat eater. Carnivore is a biological order that includes groups like bears, dogs, and cats, and while these animals are generally carnivores, some are omnivores, and some are vegetarians. Red pandas are classified as carnivores because they’re descended from the same ancestors as the other carnivores, but they rarely eat anything other than bamboo and a few insects. </p>
				<li><i>They are their own kind.</i></li>
					<p>By the 1980s, genetic evidence indicated that giant pandas actually were a type of bear, and red pandas belonged in their own family, the Ailuridae. They might seem similar, but they’re not related. </p>

				<li><h3><i>Where does the name panda come from?</i></h3>
					<p>The origin of the name 'panda' comes from the Nepali word <i>ponya</i> which means "bamboo or plant eating animal".  </p></li>
				<li><h3><i>Why are red pandas becoming exinct</i></h3>
					<p>The main cause of red panda endangerment is habitit decrease. Much of red panda forests have been destroyed due to a number of factors.</p></li>
				<li><h3><i>How many red pandas are left?</i></h3>
					<p>According to World Wildlife Fund, there are fewer than 10,000 red pandas left in the wild.</p></li></ul>
